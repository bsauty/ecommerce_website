# ecommerce_website
First website for school project, ecommerce and lost objects platform for university in 2017

  - "annonces" contains the pictures of all the pictures for the ads
  - "content" contains all the pages the website can call
  - "css", "font" and "images" are for the appearance of the website
  - "js" contains all the javascript instructions (mostly jquery)
  
All comments are in french and the coding style is pretty basic. I have gained a lot of experience since in personnal projects and internships but I have not taken the time to improve the original code.
